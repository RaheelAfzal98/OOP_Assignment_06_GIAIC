# OOP_Assignments_06_GIAIC

üìò **Python OOP Practice Assignments (Traditional Style)**
This repository offers 21 structured assignments designed to strengthen your understanding of traditional Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python. Each task is organized in its own directory and includes an app.py file with working, well-commented code examples.

üîç**Assignment Overview** 
**Using self:** Create a Student class that sets and prints attributes using instance reference.

**Using cls:** Use a class variable and method to count how many objects are created.

**Public Attributes and Methods:** Show how to access public members outside the class.

**Class Members:** Understand how class-level variables behave across instances.

**Static Method Example:** Define a helper method that belongs to a class but uses no instance data.

**Constructor & Destructor**: Automatically perform actions when objects are created or deleted.

**Encapsulation Levels:** Work with public, protected, and private variables in practice.

**Calling Parent Class:** Use super() to initialize parent attributes in a child class.

**Using Abstract Base Classes:** Use the abc module to enforce method implementation.

**Instance-Level Methods:** Operate using values tied to individual objects.

**Counting with Class Method:** Keep track of data added across instances using @classmethod.

**Static Utility:** Use a static method to convert values (e.g., Celsius to Fahrenheit).

**Class Composition:** Embed one object within another to model "has-a" relationships.

**Aggregation Pattern:** Link classes without creating tight dependencies.

**Diamond Problem & MRO:** See how Python resolves method calls in multiple inheritance scenarios.

**Function-Level Decorators:** Add logging behavior before a function runs.

**Enhancing Classes with Decorators:** Inject new methods into a class using a decorator.

**Property Management:** Use property decorators to control access and mutation of private data.

**Callable Objects:** Make objects act like functions using __call__.

**User-Defined Exceptions:** Raise and handle a custom exception class.

**Building an Iterable:** Define __iter__ and __next__ to support looping over your class.

üì¶ **Prerequisites**
You don‚Äôt need any external libraries. These scripts run on standard Python 3 without any extra setup.

üéØ **Objective**
These exercises are built to reinforce essential OOP skills in Python by covering:

Object lifecycle

Inheritance patterns

Data encapsulation

Polymorphic behavior

Abstract design

Decorators and dunder methods

**Happy coding and mastering OOP!** üß†üíª
